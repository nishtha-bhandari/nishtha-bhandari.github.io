    <h1>My Anecdote of Quarantine-2020</h1>
    <hr>
    <img src="img/city.jpg">
    <p> The last day I went to the city,it was pouring heavily. I enjoyed the weather and was making plans with my friends for the weekend.Little did I know that we were going to be quarantined.</p>
    <img src="img/park.jpg">
    <p>I went to the park near my home many times for a walk. I was very shocked to see the empty playground. There was a strange silence all around. I was missing the children who played joyfully in the park.</p>
    <img src="img/close.jpg">
    <p> Everything is shut down due to the Covid-19. When I went to 99 cents store for a stroll, I saw this message.</p>
    <img src="img/walkk.jpg">
    <p>The last time I went for a walk.</p>
    <p>I decided to get over the gloominess and make effective use of this quarantine in learning new skills.</p>
    <img src="img/noodles.jpg">
    <p>I learnt cooking from my mom. After spending many days in the kitchen, I finally learnt to make spaghetti. This is the first dish that I made without anybody's help.</p>
    <img src="img/5.jpg">
    <p>I completed the whole series of'Money Heist'on Netflix which eventually turned out to be my favorite show.</p>
    <img src="img/bday.jpg">
    <p>This time we celebrated our father's birthday in a different manner in the quarantine mode yet We had a really great time and tried to make it memorable.</p>
    <img src="img/birds.jpg">
    <p>Most of the times, I hear tweaking of birds from my window. Sometimes I wonder if the animals think 'Where are these humans?'</p>
    <img src="img/12.jpg">
    <p> Everyday, I check my Cunyfirst to be updated on my homeworks and grades.</p>
    <img src="img/food.jpg">
    <p>We ordered a good quantity of food and essentials from Amazon. This reflects how the pandemic has chnaged the way we shop.<p/>
    <img src="img/veer.jpg">
    <p>My baby brother Veer is very lovely and naughty and spending time with him is very valuable to me. We expermineted a haircut on him at our home.It was priceless to see him setting his hair infront of the mirror.</p>
    <img src="img/windows.jpg">
    <p>Sometimes, being confined in a room seems difficult. Initially I felt very anxious but then I realized that we should go with the flow and hope for the things to be better soon.It isn't easy for everybody to be stuck inside but we can make use of this time in building great relationships with our families and learning new skills.</p>
